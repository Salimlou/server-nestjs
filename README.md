# NestJS - Prisma - Apollo 2

### Using Prisma

* For using Prisma you should signup to https://app.prisma.io/ and deploy your server on it and the replace the end point in .env file

## Description

### Motivation to use NestJS

* We already have the GraphQLModule in NestJS that is nothing more than a wrapper around the Apollo server. We don't reinvent the wheel but provide a ready to use a module instead, that brings a clean way to play with the GraphQL and Nest together.
